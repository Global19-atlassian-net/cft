To generate the v2 client and its dependencies:

1. Open the pom in  /generateDependencies, and update the versions of v2 and reactor that need to be built. Look for this section in the pom:
	<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.cloudfoundry</groupId>
        <artifactId>cloudfoundry-client-reactor</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.1.RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
    The complete list of dependencies and their repositories that need to be included in the pom can be found in the v2 Java client github main page:
    https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client#cloud-foundry-java-client
    
    Generally, just copy/paste the XML shown in CF v2 client  github page.
    
2. Clean package the pom in /generateDependencies folder (i.e. mvn clean package) using command line

3. DELETE the ENTIRE /dependencies folder in the v2 client plugin

4. In generateDependencies/target directory, move the /dependencies folder to top-level in the v2 client plugin (essentially the old /dependencies is replaced with a new one)

5. DELETE all the old /dependecies jars in .classpath and MANIFEST.MF in the v2 client plugin

6. Add all the NEW jar dependencies (via Eclipse plugin editor UI) to .classpath and MANIFEST.MF
